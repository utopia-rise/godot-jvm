/**
 * Mesh with a single Point primitive.
 *
 * The PointMesh is made from a single point. Instead of relying on triangles, points are rendered as a single rectangle on the screen with a constant size. They are intended to be used with Particle systems, but can be used as a cheap way to render constant size billboarded sprites (for example in a point cloud).
 *
 * PointMeshes, must be used with a material that has a point size. Point size can be accessed in a shader with `POINT_SIZE`, or in a [godot.SpatialMaterial] by setting [godot.SpatialMaterial.flagsUsePointSize] and the variable [godot.SpatialMaterial.paramsPointSize].
 *
 * When using PointMeshes, properties that normally alter vertices will be ignored, including billboard mode, grow, and cull face.
