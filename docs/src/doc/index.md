Godot-Jvm is a Godot module which allows you to write your game or application logic in Kotlin on the JVM.

An embedded JRE will be shipped with your application to ensure it runs on systems that don't have java installed.

If you are new to this language module, it is recommended to read through the [Versioning](versioning.md) and the [Getting started](getting-started/gradle.md) sections first.
Please also note the [API differences](api-differences.md) section which covers some important difference to the scripting and workflow compared to GDScript.
