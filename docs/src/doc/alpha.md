# What's not working:
The items in this list are explicitly mentioned here as these will be implemented in future versions. Also consider the [Api differences](api-differences.md) section for general differences and limitations which will not be or cannot be adressed in the near forseable future or ever.

- Each registered constructor must have a unique number of arguments. Constructor overloading is not yet supported
- No tool mode (you can set it already in the `@RegisterClass` annotation but it has no effect yet)
- No plugin support -> You cannot use Godot Kotlin/JVM to write plugins and addons yet
- Only desktop OS (Linux, MacOS, Windows) and Android are supported for now
