We encourage you to contribute to the project if you want. Even if you don't have any idea how the module works or if it seems overwhelming at first, we're here to help you getting started.

## Keywords
The following keywords are used throughout the contribution documentation:

- `godot-root`: root dir in which the godot engine is cloned into
- `module-dir`: root dir of our module

## Discussions
Most of our discussions are happening on Discord. So if you have Discord or don't mind starting using it, feel free to [join](https://discord.gg/zpb5Ru7v9x) our server.  
But don't worry if you don't have or want to use Discord. Then the discussions are just in the corresponding issue.  
If you discuss on Discord though: don't forget to document all relevant outcome in the corresponding issue.  

If you have critique or an opinion on a discussed topic, please be kind and give valuable feedback.  
If you are on the receiving end of the critique: don't take it personally. Many people are no native english speaker and it can happen that something which is not rude at all in the language of the writer, might sound rude in english.
