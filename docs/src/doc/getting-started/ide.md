To get proper syntax highlighting, code completion and so on, you will need an external code editor. We do not, and will never support the built in one from Godot. Although you can of course use it for light editing if needed.  
We strongly recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://jetbrains.com/idea) (The community edition is free of charge) but other IDE's like Eclipse or VSCode will also work. But we only provide first class support for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://jetbrains.com/idea).  
The easiest way to install and update it is via the [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) app.

## Intellij IDEA plugin
We provide a [Intellij plugin](TODO()) which provides additional source code inspections, warnings, error detection and quick fixes specific to the way this module works. We strongly recommend using it as it provides you with a lot of useful checks and helpers to detect errors before compilation.

## Importing
Once your IDE is set up you can import your project.

Click `Open` and select your project's `build.gradle.kts` file. The IDE will take some time to index your project, but once done you can start coding!
