If you have our Intellij plugin installed (see [IDE](ide.md)), you can automatically setup a new project using our project creation wizard.  
If not, you have to manually setup a project. Read in the [gradle](gradle.md) section on how to set it up manually.  
Otherwise you can read on.

# Getting our custom engine build
You can download our custom engine build and export templates from the latest [github release](https://github.com/utopia-rise/godot-kotlin-jvm/releases).  
If you need other modules you can also build it yourself. See [here](../contribution/setup.md) on how to do it.

That's it! Now continue with [adding your first class](add-first-class.md).
