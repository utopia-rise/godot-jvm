# Godot JVM

# Kotlin/Jvm binding for the Godot Game Engine

## Overview

This is a **Kotlin** language binding for the [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/) game engine. It is built as a module (like the C# binding) to interact with **Godot**'s core internally. The binding provides you Godot API's as Kotlin classes, so you can write your game logic completely in Kotlin. Your code will be compiled into a jar which is then executed by an embedded jvm so you don't have to worry that your users (gamers) have java installed. It's already embedded in your games executable.
You also don't have to worry about any binding logic. Just write your game scripts like you would for [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html) or [C#](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/) but with all the syntactic sugar of kotlin.

## Important notes

This version of the binding is currently **WIP**! It cannot be used to build games yet.  
For a more stable, yet much less performant binding using Kotlin Native instead of Kotlin on the JVM, visit [godot-kotlin](https://github.com/utopia-rise/godot-kotlin).  

## Documentation

Documentation will be added once the binding reaches the **Alpha** state.

## Contribution Guidelines:
- **CodeStyle:**  
We enforce the code style to match the official kotlin [coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html). Read there on how to set those up for your IDE.  
We will enforce this later on through CI and linting.  
- **Branching:**  
Once we reach Alpha state, we'll do branching like described in `git-flow`.

Each Issue has a Maintainer that is the "supervisor" for the general topic the issue belongs to. Discuss implementation details with this maintainer.

## Setting up the project for local development
1. Clone godot repo.

2. In `godot/`, run the following commands:
   ```
   git submodule add git@github.com:utopia-rise/godot-jvm.git modules/kotlin_jvm
   scons -j8 platform=x11 # your platform
   ```

3. Setup Protobuf:  
    https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/src (install the java version, which already includes cpp)
    - `./configure --disable-shared CXXFLAGS="-fPIC" --prefix=<repo-root>/libprotobuf`
    - `make`
    - `make install`

4. Build sample
    - navigate to `harness/tests`
    - `./gradlew build`


## Windows instructions

0. Install CMake with chocolatey
1. Clone protobuf repo:
`https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/`
2. Mkdir and cd to `cmake/build/release`
3. Configure project with : ```
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<repo-root>/libprotobuf ../.. ```
4. Install with : `nmake install`
